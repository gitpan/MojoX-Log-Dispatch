MojoX-Log-Dispatch

MojoX::Log::Dispatch - Log::Dispatch For Mojo
MojoX::Log::Dispatch - wrapper around Log::Dispatch module. Log::Dispatch manages a set of Log::Dispatch::* objects, allowing you to add and remove output objects as desired.

Include log statements at various levels throughout your code.
Then when you create the new logging object, set the minimum log level you
want to keep track off.
Set it low, to 'debug' for development, then higher in production.
